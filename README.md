# Spotify BPM Playlist Builder

[demo image here, after design is implemented]

Spotify BPM Playlist Builder is a web app that lets users build new playlists based off of a BPM (beats per minute) range. Its intended to facilitate playlist creation for jogging, walking, etc. 

A lot of the source code was adapted from [Next Spotify V2](https://github.com/ankitk26/Next-Spotify-v2) by [ankitk26](https://github.com/ankitk26) - thank you Ankit!
